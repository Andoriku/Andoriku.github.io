<p>Hello! My name is Andrew Jordan. I am a Designer, Developer, Artist, and Musician. I am from Asuncion, Paraguay
but was raised in Milwaukee, WI. Attending Whitefish Bay High School set me up for success at MIAD (The
Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design), in which I graduated with a B.F.A. in Industrial Design.</p>
<p>From there, I began my career at <a href="https://www.steelcase.com/">Steelcase Inc</a>.
As a part of the Global Design Studio, I worked on futures projects and an economy class of modular
work desks. After Steelcase, I worked at <a href="https://corporate.kohls.com/">Kohls Corporate</a> as
a floorplan management specialist. I have also worked at WeightUp Solutions and 42 Lounge. Currently I am a
UI/UX Designer and Project manager at <a href="https://www.tsrapplabs.com/">TSR AppLabs</a>.</p>
 <hr>
 <p class="last">Now, as a student at devCodeCamp, I am starting the new chapter in my career. Learning full stack
 development, I am transitioning into the role of Jr. Developer at TSR. This site was actually created by myself.
 If you want to know more, just drop me a line in the <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> section.</p>
